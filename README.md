This is the codes that I wrote for a Blazor Tutorial on YouTube on the topic of Flux in C#

# State Management with Flux in C# 
State management becomes very important in the front end frameworks since the front end components are stateful. Dealing with state in stateful components could become messy really quickly. Angular, React and VueJs all have their own way of doing state management. (React is definitely less opinionated). However, Blazor doesn't have a built in state management system.

In these two videos, I help you understand what Flux is and implement Flux in C#.
